    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Preheat the Oven:</h2>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).</li>
        <li><h2>Prepare the Prime Rib:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Place the prime rib in a roasting pan with the fat side up.</li>
                <li>Rub the surface with olive oil, ensuring even coverage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Seasoning:</h2>Generously season the prime rib with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, and dried rosemary. Adjust quantities based on personal taste preferences.</li>
        <li><h2>Roasting:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven for 15 minutes to sear the meat.</li>
            <li>After searing, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>Continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer for accuracy (about 20 minutes per pound for medium-rare).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Resting:</h2>Allow the prime rib to rest for at least 15-20 minutes before carving. This helps retain juices and ensures a moist and flavorful result.</li>
        <li><h2>Carving:</h2>Carve and serve the prime rib, enjoying the succulent and well-seasoned meat.</li>
